# Intro to Github

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Github](https://github.com/) (or the like, i.e. [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com/)) are tools to help you manage your code and collaborate.

[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is an open source tool that allows you to store code, track the changes that you made, and collaborate with others.

[Github](https://github.com/) (or the like, i.e. [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com/)) act as an external place that you can use get in a place that is accessible to others. As you may have noticed, this project is hosted on Github.

These tools are great tools that you should have in your tool belt. These notes, walk through the very basic usage of Git and communities like Github.

### Why are these tool important?

Git is easiest to understand through online communities such as Github. On Github, you can find the code for a lots of projects that you can use! Here are some interesting ones:

- [MIZZOU/IRE Scraping Class](https://github.com/ireapps/scraping-class)
  Here, you will find the code that we worked on during the class.
- [Requests library](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests)
  Requests is the python library that we used in the class.
- [CSVkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit)
  CSVkit is another tool that you can use to interact with csvs.
- [United States](https://github.com/unitedstates/)
  This is a repo of data that is across the whole country.
- etc.

Essentially, this repositories of code are available for you to use and contribute to OR you can create your own and share it with others.

Lastly, you can use Github to store your own code for your own sanity and tracking. A lot of people use this space as a scratch pad, so don't worry about sharing you project while it is in development.

However, if you want to hide your projects, you can do one of the following:
- Free private repositories for eduction: [Github Education](https://education.github.com/)
- Pay monthly fee for github: [Github](https://www.github.com/)
- Free private repositories: Join [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com/)


Let's get started...

## Setting up

To start using, there are two major things for our set up that we need to do.
1. Install git on your machine
2. Sign up for Github

Note: Gitlab is much the same, but a different layout. For this tutorial, we are using Github.

### Install git on your machine

- Mac: Run this on your commandline: ```brew install git```
 - If you do not have homebrew, you will need to install homebrew, then rerun the command above.

   ```ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"```

- Windows: Download and install the following: http://msysgit.github.io
