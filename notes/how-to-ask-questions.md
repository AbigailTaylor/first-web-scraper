# How to Ask Questions

Inevitably, we'll all need to ask for some coding help. It doesn't matter if you're emailing an instructor, emailing a listserv, posting on Stack Overflow, or even just tweeting out a question, here are some guidelines that will help you get answers:

### 1. Do your own research first
Many times, someone else has had the same question as you, and asked that question on the Internet. [Google your problem](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2014/03/13/googling-for-code-solutions-can-be-tricky-heres-how-to-get-started/) or search listserv archives. Try any of the solutions you find to see if it works for you. If it does, then you're done!

If solutions aren't working, keep track of what you've tried, as well as what happened when you tried them. When you post your question, you'll want to explain what you've already done.

### 2. Be specific
When asking your question, be specific. This means your post should include:

* The tools you're using
* What you're trying to accomplish (What should be happening if everything worked?)
* The code you're using (or just the relevant parts)
* Any error messages you got
* What you've tried already, and what happened

Here's an example:
I'm trying to scrape the Boone County inmate roster using Python, and the requests and BeautifulSoup packages. The error I'm getting says:

<pre>"File "test.py", line 5
    url = http://www.showmeboone.com/sheriff/JailResidents/JailResidents.asp
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax"</pre>
